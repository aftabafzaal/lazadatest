Using one of modern PHP frameworks (sf2, zf2, Laravel, Yii2) you should implement system  for API calls (no frontend part but you can add Swagger or similar tool to explore your api).  Your JSON-REST full api (not JSON-RPC) should provide CRUD access to two resources  without any security check:  ?  Post (with fields like: title, body and so on)  ?  Tags (with only name field) many-to-may relation with posts    Additional methods for API:  ?  select all posts by tag or tags  ?  count posts by tag or tags    After any post created system should send email to specified in configuration file Email.   After any post removed system should log information about it.
